                Hi.
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Kyle. I am currently a PhD student studying Computer Science
                I am a PhD student studying Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.uic.edu/uic/" target="_blank">
                University of Illinois at Chicago</a> and a research assistant in the
                <a href="http://evl.uic.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Electronic Visualization Laboratory</a>,
                <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/creativecoding/" target="_blank">Creative Coding</a> research group.
                My primary research focus involves multi-temporal volume rendering and visualization of
                neuroimaging data, however my interests extend to Information Visualization, Language
                Development, and function Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                I received my Bachelors degree in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences at the University of
                Arizona and spent the better part of a decade working as a Research Technician in the
                <a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~eplante/index.html" target="_blank">Plante Lab</a> directed by Dr. Elena
                Plante where we utilized fMRI to explore how the brain processes language. Now I am developing
                new and interesting ways of exploring neuroimaging data to better understand the complexities
                of the human brain.
